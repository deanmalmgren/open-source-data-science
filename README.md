open source data science
========================

Generally speaking, I cringe whenever someone asks me "what tools do
you use?" because I have found that tools tend to limit one's thinking
on how to solve a problem. As the
[saying goes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_instrument):

> I suppose it is tempting, if the only tool you have is a hammer, to

But the fact of the matter is that many people are not aware of the
vast array of open source tools that they have at their disposal when
facing data science problems---myself included! The goal of this
project is to build awareness of the most important tools, packages,
programs, etc in a manner that is as accessible as possible to the
data science community. I'm putting this on github with the explicit
intent to have the community propose other tools or other forms of
organization that are useful.

The idea for this project originally came from a conversation I had
with @ahwolf and how difficult it is for data science n00bs to
understand how all these tools come together. This project is an
attempt to address that need.

contributing
------------

This presentation is hosted via Github Pages and is intended to evolve
over time as more tools become available and the landscape of open
source tools changes. The goal here is not necessarily to include
every available tool under the sun --- there are far too many for
that --- but rather to identify a set of core tools that data scientists
find most relevant and useful. Packages, frameworks, and tools are
likely to be added and removed as their importance and relevance ebbs,
but the intent is to keep this repository up to date.

There are many ways to contribute, all of which are greatly appreciated:

* adding new packages (see [tools.json](tools.json))

* adding or editing metadata to existing packages (see
  [tools.json](tools.json))

* improvements to the presentation (see [index.html](index.html))

* other things that are also awesome and helpful ideas that I haven't
  contemplated.
